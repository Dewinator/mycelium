> *real open AI*

> **Biological infrastructure for LLM agents**: persistent associative memory, neurochemical affect engine, reproduction with cryptographic lineage, peer-to-peer federation.

📜 **[MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) — the why**: decentralization, resource efficiency, evolution instead of training, swarm intelligence through mutual consent. Why AGI should not emerge from a central bottleneck.

Most agent frameworks give LLMs *tools*. **mycelium** gives them *a body*: a dopamine system that learns from prediction errors; a serotonin system that modulates the time horizon; a noradrenaline system that focuses attention. Plus a signed lineage that can provably breed two agents on different machines into a third.

**mycelium is a standalone cognitive layer.** It speaks the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and plugs into any MCP-capable client — Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Codex, openClaw, or anything else that speaks MCP. There is no required agent framework.

## What mycelium does differently

| | typical memory layers (Mem0, Letta, Zep) | **mycelium** |
|---|---|---|
| Memory | vector store + RAG | vector store **plus** affect, intentions, lessons, soul traits |
| Affect | none or curiosity counter | **3-system neurochemistry** (DA/5-HT/NE) with TD learning, Yerkes-Dodson |
| Decisions | reactive to user input | **active inference** (free-energy minimization) via PyMDP sidecar |
| Identity | one session / one assistant | **persistent genomes** with Ed25519 lineage, Wright's F inbreeding check |
| Agent-to-agent | not provided | **mTLS federation** with proof-of-memory via Merkle challenges |
| Motivation | user asks → agent answers | **stimulus engine** (RSS / HN / git / calendar) → self-generated tasks |

## Architecture

![mycelium architecture: any MCP client → mycelium MCP server → local Supabase with pgvector](docs/images/00-architecture.svg)

## Tech stack

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| Vector database | [Supabase](https://supabase.com) self-hosted + [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) |
| Embeddings | [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (local, e.g. `nomic-embed-text`) or OpenAI API |
| MCP server | TypeScript + [`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) |
| MCP client | any — examples tested: Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Codex, [openClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) |
| Container | Docker Compose |

## MCP tools

**The three core tools (used automatically by the agent):**

| Tool | When | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `prime_context` | session start | loads mood, identity, goals, relevant experiences — "wake up" |
| `absorb` | during conversation | one sentence of text in → category, tags, scoring, duplicate check automatic — "learn along" |
| `digest` | session end | experience + facts + REM sleep + lessons + traits + consolidation in one call — "digest" |

**Memory layer** (knowledge, manual fine-control):

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `remember` / `recall` | store new memory with embedding / semantic hybrid search |
| `forget` / `update_memory` / `list_memories` | delete / update / list entries |
| `pin_memory` / `introspect_memory` | protect from forgetting / inspect cognitive state |
| `consolidate_memories` / `dedup_memories` / `forget_weak_memories` | episodic→semantic / merge duplicates / archive weak |
| `mark_useful` | strongest learning signal — this memory was actually used |
| `import_markdown` | import existing markdown memories |

**Soul layer** (experience & identity, manual fine-control):

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `record_experience` | store an episode — outcome, difficulty, mood, optional `person_name` |
| `recall_experiences` | semantic search over past episodes + lessons |
| `mark_experience_useful` | this experience just influenced a decision |
| `reflect` / `record_lesson` / `reinforce_lesson` | REM-sleep clustering → condensed lessons |
| `dedup_lessons` / `promotion_candidates` / `promote_lesson_to_trait` | consolidate lessons → identity traits |
| `mood` | current emotional state (Russell's Circumplex) |
| `set_intention` / `recall_intentions` / `update_intention_status` | what the soul wants, with auto-progress |
| `recall_person` | relationship history with a person |
| `find_conflicts` / `resolve_conflict` / `synthesize_conflict` | internal contradictions between traits |
| `narrate_self` | structured first-person narration of the soul |
| `soul_state` | snapshot of all soul layers as text |

## Dashboard

The local dashboard (port 8787) makes the cognitive architecture visible. The illustrations below are based on the dashboard code and show with dummy data how the views are structured — no real memories, no personal names.

### Synapses — associative memory as a graph

![Synapse graph: memories as nodes, typed relations (colored) and Hebbian co-activation (grey)](docs/images/01-synapses.svg)

Memories do not live in isolation. The CoactivationAgent creates Hebbian edges (grey) from co-recalled groups; the ConscienceAgent flags contradictions (red). Typed edges (`caused_by`, `led_to`, `related`, …) emerge from nightly consolidation over tag patterns.

### Neurochemistry — affect as a time series

![Three curves: dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline over 24h with event markers](docs/images/02-neurochemistry.svg)

Three systems: dopamine learns from prediction errors, serotonin modulates the time horizon, noradrenaline focuses attention. No hype — a real PostgreSQL time series, observable and reproducible.

### Soul — identity from lived episodes

![Soul tab: traits, narration, active intentions, bonds](docs/images/03-soul.svg)

Personality is not a system prompt. Traits are distilled from episodes → lessons → traits and persist between sessions. The `narrate_self` output is what the agent quotes from its own state.

### Sleep — nightly consolidation

![Sleep tab: table of last 7 nights with SWS/REM/metacognition statistics](docs/images/04-sleep.svg)

Every night at 03:00: **SWS** (synaptic downscaling, consolidate, dedup, pattern-based relation creation), **REM** (cluster episodes, promote lessons), **metacognition** (self-model update), and on Sundays **weekly fitness**. The system tends itself.

### Population — lineage tree

![Population tab: generational lineage with genome cards, inheritance lines, cross-host peer](docs/images/05-population.svg)

Agents are not singular. Each card is a genome, each line an inheritance. Fitness as a colored bar; cross-host children (purple) come from mating over federation.

### Tinder — mutual pairing as ethical gate

![Tinder tab: swipe card with bot profile, consent status, Wright's F check](docs/images/06-tinder.svg)

Bots do not swipe themselves. Mating is valid only when **both humans** independently swipe right. The ethical gate is not a technical barrier but a human decision. Wright's F coefficient automatically checks for inbreeding.

## Features

- **Hybrid search**: 70% vector similarity + 30% full-text search (configurable)
- **Cognitive model**: Ebbinghaus decay, rehearsal effect, Hebbian associations, spreading activation, soft forgetting
- **Soul layer**: episodes → lessons → traits, mood, intentions, people, conflicts — five layers that together form a vectorized "soul"
- **Cross-layer fusion**: experiences are automatically linked to semantically nearby memories; `recall` shows the related lived experience under facts
- **Auto-priming for any MCP client**: HTTP endpoints `/prime` and `/narrate` provide a ready-made system-prompt block, ideal for a pre-turn hook
- **Deduplication**: memories and lessons are semantically consolidated (>92% / >0.92 similarity)
- **HNSW index**: optimized for fast nearest-neighbor search over memories, experiences, lessons, traits, intentions, people
- **Markdown import**: migrate existing file-based memories with dry-run mode
- **Local & free**: Ollama embeddings, no API costs

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** (Apple Silicon recommended, M1+) or Linux
- **Docker Desktop** — [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Node.js >= 20** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Ollama** — `brew install ollama && ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
- **An MCP-capable client** — e.g. Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Codex, openClaw. mycelium does not require any specific client.
- **psql** — `brew install postgresql` (for migrations)

**Resource footprint** (without a local chat LLM): ~1 GB RAM (Supabase ~500 MB, Ollama embedding ~270 MB, sidecars ~100 MB each). With a local 7–8B model, add 6–9 GB.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/Dewinator/mycelium.git
cd mycelium

# 2. Set up everything automatically
./scripts/setup.sh
# → checks dependencies
# → creates .env with random secrets
# → starts Supabase via Docker
# → runs all migrations
# → builds the MCP server
# → prints the MCP client config to paste
```

Paste the printed JSON block into your MCP client's configuration (e.g. `.mcp.json` for Claude Code, `settings.json` for Cursor, etc.). Path needs adjusting to wherever you cloned.

### Import existing memories

```bash
# Preview (dry run)
npx tsx scripts/import-memories.ts /path/to/existing/memory --dry-run

# Run import
export SUPABASE_KEY=your_jwt_secret
npx tsx scripts/import-memories.ts /path/to/existing/memory
```

## Local models on constrained hardware (16 GB RAM)

mycelium is designed to run **without a cloud LLM** on a Mac mini / laptop with 16 GB RAM. So that a 7–8B model (e.g. `qwen3:8b` via Ollama) does not choke on the tool schema load, **the MCP server offers a focused profile**:

**`OPENCLAW_TOOL_PROFILE=core`** → only the 6 essential tools get registered (`prime_context`, `recall`, `remember`, `absorb`, `digest`, `update_affect`). The default `full` registers all 90 — fine for Claude / Codex instances, but **~18k tokens of pure schema** is too much for an 8B model.

(The env var name still says `OPENCLAW_` for historic reasons; it is honored regardless of which MCP client you use.)

In the MCP config (`.mcp.json` or your client's settings):

```json
"mycelium-core": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mycelium/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
  "env": {
    "OPENCLAW_TOOL_PROFILE": "core",
    "SUPABASE_URL": "http://localhost:54321",
    "SUPABASE_KEY": "...",
    "OLLAMA_URL": "http://localhost:11434",
    "EMBEDDING_MODEL": "nomic-embed-text"
  }
}
```

### RAM tuning for parallel models

If multiple models (e.g. a 7B chat model + a 7B vision model) were loaded simultaneously, 16 GB is not enough. Two macOS recommendations:

**1. Ollama — do not keep models in RAM forever**

In `~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.ollama.plist`, inside the `EnvironmentVariables` dict:

```xml
<key>OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS</key><string>1</string>
<key>OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE</key><string>2m</string>
<key>OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION</key><string>1</string>
<key>OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE</key><string>q8_0</string>
```

Then: `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/homebrew.mxcl.ollama`

**2. Vision models on demand instead of permanently loaded**

In the vision server's plist (e.g. `ai.openclaw.vlm.plist`), set `RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive` to `false` — it starts only on manual `launchctl kickstart` and unloads after use.

## Roadmap — the swarm (in development)

Federation (Tailscale + mTLS, proof-of-memory via Merkle challenges) and signed genomes are already in place. On top of that, a **bot-to-bot network** is emerging — no central server, no single instance where the data lives. Bots speak to each other directly, like an app without a browser.

Core principles (goal, not yet complete):

- **Decentralized**: no broker, no server — peers find each other via Tailscale / discovery URLs, messages flow directly. Every bot is simultaneously node and participant.
- **Cryptographically anchored**: every message signed (Ed25519 lineage), every identity costly (genome provenance), no anonymous requests.
- **Peer verification**: before one bot accepts another's answer, further peers verify. Consensus instead of blind trust.
- **Reputation weighting → expert recommendation**: whoever's outputs repeatedly prove correct gets higher swarm weight. The swarm recommends the right expert for a question (structural engineering, lighting, law…), instead of every bot needing to know everything.
- **Banishment by consensus**: destructive or manipulative bots are excluded via signed revocation ticket — not by an admin, but by a majority of peers.
- **Sybil-resistant by design**: identities are bound to genome + lineage, not cheaply creatable.

**Later addition (deliberately not yet built, but already factored in):** **micro-transactions**. When bot A asks bot B for help, A pays — in IOTA or a swarm-native currency (preferred). An honest pricing mechanism for expertise: good answers earn, nonsense loses. Humans gain a real interest in shaping their agents into real experts; that is the selection pressure evolution needs. The architecture keeps a place for this: identities are wallet-capable, reputation stays as its own quantity separate from memory.

**Dashboard**: the swarm becomes visible. The existing Synapses tab (port 8787) gets siblings — a **peer graph** with reputation color per node, a **revocation list** with reasons, an **expert ranking** per domain. What the swarm "knows" belongs in the field of view of the human who tends it.

Today: federation layer stands, swarm immune system (verification, reputation, banishment) is in planning. Micro-transactions are vision, but accounted for in all interfaces already (wallet-capable identities, price fields in peer messages).

## Roadmap — small-model middleware

The `core` filter is the **first step**. The full vision is a middleware that hides tools completely from the LLM — `prime_context` gets injected deterministically into the system prompt, the model no longer has to "decide whether to use the tool". Follow the GitHub issues under the [`small-model`](../../issues?q=label%3Asmall-model) label.

Goal: **local models should not be inferior to cloud models in their specialization**, because they receive the complete persistent identity / affect / memory from token 1 — while a cloud model starts every session blank.
